      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        A tool that has an improved version of a UI regarding code review, changing the way in which code is displayed to make it more dynamic
        so that it is easier for change authors to explain their changes and reviewers to understand them.
      </p>
      <h3>Who are we</h3>
      <p>
        We are 3 university students, who made this tool as end project for our bachelor degree in Computer Science at the TU Delft.
